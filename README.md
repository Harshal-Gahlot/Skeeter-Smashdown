### About
<b>Hello, Welcome to Skeeter Smashdown, an INDIE game that I, Harshal Gahlot have created from scratch as a solo developer and programmer. It took me over 160 hours of hard work to create this game. I hope you found it as enjoyable to play as I did to develop it. Thanks for checking it out.</b>
This is a game that I developed a year ago as a project to test my skills.

requirements: python, python library "pygame" 
### Broad overview of how I approached it(This was written in march 2023 after I called the game done):

1. Basic pygame set-up
2. First made a working game with shapes and colors i.e. circles were coming instead of mosquitos
3. Intrudused game difficulty mode: Easy, Normal and Hardcore mode
4. Used fonts and images of mosquitos and racket after game base/logic/fundaments were made
5. Created my Button class and made it as customizable as I can
6. Made menu with Game Mode, About, How to Play section
7. Optimised the game a lot by rewriting an independent FPS game which made the game a whole lot smoother
8. Added music and sound
9. Added setting section which has a music volume bar that also affects the music volume
10. Learn git and upload my project (march 2024)

<b>Note:</b> I halted the game development as I wanted to develop it only after uploading it to Git Hub but I found myself lost in Git and could not understand it back in 2023, hence there are some unnecessary code and bugs/broken things such as 'about' text in 'how to play' and not good looking 'setting' related graphics.
Also, I am sorry for my bad spelling/typo in the code file.
